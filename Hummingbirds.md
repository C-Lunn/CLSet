A C#m F#m E x2

       A              C#m            F#m
It's starting to feel empty on your side 
       F#m       E        A
I can feel the seasons changing
       C#m       F#m
and I never realised
       F#m E        A
Where it all went wrong
          C#m             F#m
so I'll start off from the top
     F#m    E        A
I'll start again strong
    C#m          F#m    F#m E A
as I mean to go on 


Bm              D             F#m                F#m      E
everything I've ever seen has merged and made us meant to be
Bm              D            E     E7
the make believe reality of love 


           A     C#m              F#m
cause it's everything you've ever known
F#m     E        A      C#      F#m   
oh it's just so hard to let it go
     F#m  E        A         C#m        F#m
it's everywhere you look when you feel alone
     F#m  E          A         C#m        F#m     F#m E
it's everything you touch and everything you hold


Bm              D             F#m                F#m      E
fields of static caravans and children playing in the sand 
Bm              D             F#m                F#m      E
a hummingbird leaving his nest to serenade his flying friends
Bm              D       F#m                   F#m      E
I know there's serenity inside the storm that engulfs me
Bm              D            E     E7
I hope I never see the end



           A     C#m              F#m
cause it's everything you've ever known
F#m     E        A      C#      F#m   
oh it's just so hard to let it go
     F#m  E        A         C#m        F#m
it's everywhere you look when you feel alone
     F#m  E          A         C#m        F#m     F#m E
it's everything you touch and everything you hold



D           C#m       E            F#m     E    D
    I'll be back here soon but I'm leaving here tonight
       C#m       E                 F#m     E    D
going over the horizon but I'll be disappearing out of sight
         C#m       E     F#m     E    D
but I'll wait for you to be back by my side
         A                E   E7
when my tears are running dry

G
    She said it's getting late
D                           Am
    It's last orders at the bar

    Just getting started
C                     G
    Already gone too far
                       D                            Am
    Sip up your drinks now, you'll never be a superstar
                         Cm
    You'll always end up right here where you are

I've got

Em
Multiple drinks in multiple rooms
D
I've spent half of the night in the bathroom
Em                                                  D
They're on their way home but I'm on my way out
Em
The barman's given us the lethal injection
D
That's kept us sedated, since its inception
Em
Been waiting five minutes and I'm feeling bereft
D
(Oi, how much time we got left?)


G
    She said it's getting late
D                           Am
    It's last orders at the bar

    Just getting started
C                     G
    Already gone too far
                       D                            Am
    Sip up your drinks now, you'll never be a superstar
                         Cm
    You'll always end up right here where you are

So

Em
Turn up the tap, and let me see
D
If I get five then I get a shot for free, well
Em                                      D
Everybody gather round, this next one's on me
Em                             D
Barkeep's coming over, with a sour look on his face
Em                                          D
And he's telling us to all get out of his place

And he says

G
    She said it's getting late
D                           Am
    It's last orders at the bar

    Just getting started
C                     G
    Already gone too far
                       D                            Am
    Sip up your drinks now, you'll never be a superstar
                         Cm
    I hope you didn't come here in your car

3/4 time

4/4 time

G
    And now there's no last orders
D                               Am
    We're filling buckets at the bar

    Just getting started
C                            G
    And we can never go too far
                               D                        Am
    You can throw your drinks up, sip whiskey from the jar
                         Cm
    See aliens playing cricket in the park

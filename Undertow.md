  BASS CHORDS -> F# D A E

F#                    D
Bored out of my mind, dreams are dead
      A                   E
but I can't get your face out of my head 
F#               D
Nothing left to sing about
        A                   E
but it all feels worse when you're not around

D                       E
Then you come by and my pain melts away
F#                  A
Feels like it'll be better someday
D                       E
One way or another we'll find room to breathe
     F#                  A
Then you and I can stop making believe

F#                 D          A              E
In this town with no way out, you're my only escape
F#                   D                   A          E
Concrete dreams and paper skies, they're wasting me away
F#                 D               A                   E
So let's go and show them all, how far we're willing to go
F#                   D                      A     E
We're not gonna get dragged along by life's undertow

F#            D               A                   E
Dead end job, dead end life, doing what I'm told to do
     F#                     D               
It's grinding me down, an unbreakable habit but
        A                   E
You can be my saviour, be my life jacket

       D                            E
Cause when you come around all the fog lifts away
F#                  A
Feels like it'll all get better someday
D                       E
One way or another we'll find room to breathe
     F#                  A
Then you and I can stop making believe

F#                 D          A              E
In this town with no way out, you're my only escape
F#                   D                   A          E
Concrete dreams and paper skies, they're wasting me away
F#                 D               A                   E
So let's go and show them all, how far we're willing to go
F#                   D                      A     E
We're not gonna get dragged along by life's undertow

D                 E
Don't let anyone scratch beneath
     F#              A
The surface of your skin
D          E
Cast away life's chains
F#                  A
Then it's the real you that remains

CAPO 4 CHORDS -> Em C G D 
  BASS CHORDS -> G# E B F#

G#                    E
Bored out of my mind, dreams are dead
      B                   F#
but I can't get your face out of my head 
G#               E
Nothing left to sing about
        B                   F#
but it all feels worse when you're not around

E                       F#
Then you come by and my pain melts away
G#                  B
Feels like it'll be better someday
E                       F#
One way or another we'll find room to breathe
     G#                  B
Then you and I can stop making believe

G#                 E          B              F#
In this town with no way out, you're my only escape
G#                   E                   B          F#
Concrete dreams and paper skies, they're wasting me away
G#                 E               B                   F#
So let's go and show them all, how far we're willing to go
G#                   E                      B     F#
We're not gonna get dragged along by life's undertow

G#            E               B                   F#
Dead end job, dead end life, doing what I'm told to do
     G#                     E               
It's grinding me down, an unbreakable habit but
        B                   F#
You can be my saviour, be my life jacket

       E                            F#
Cause when you come around all the fog lifts away
G#                  B
Feels like it'll all get better someday
E                       F#
One way or another we'll find room to breathe
     G#                  B
Then you and I can stop making believe

G#                 E          B              F#
In this town with no way out, you're my only escape
G#                   E                   B          F#
Concrete dreams and paper skies, they're wasting me away
G#                 E               B                   F#
So let's go and show them all, how far we're willing to go
G#                   E                      B     F#
We're not gonna get dragged along by life's undertow

E                 F#
Don't let anyone scratch beneath
     G#              B
The surface of your skin
E          F#
Cast away life's chains
G#                  B
Then it's the real you that remains

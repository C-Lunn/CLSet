        A                              B           C#
I could never say the things I said to you with my hands tied
    B          A
Tied behind my back
        B           C#       B
Through the looking glass

       A                            B
Cause everything we have's at stake
           C#                 B              A
I can't control what's taking place inside my mind
        B              C#m       B
I'm always one step behind

A                       C#m
Can't find the words to say
                 B
They're slipping away from me
           A
I can't escape
                 A
I wish I could rewind
              C#
It's pouring down
              E
Could you somehow
              B
Stop me from drowning?

A B C#m B

        A                              B           C#
I could never say the things I said to you if I'd realised
    B          A
That you had my back
        B           C#       B
Through the looking glass
       A                  B
Cause I could never calculate
           C#                 B              A
Without a diary I was always late, I had no time
        B              C#m       B
I'm always one step behind



A                       C#m

Stop me from drowning?

Cm    C#
Cause my mind's full of green slips and red pens
A
Never got time to get to know your friends
E                                          B
This is the sign that points to how it all ends And I wish I could rewind
